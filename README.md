## Abstract
In the era of modern technologies emerging at rapid pace there is no reason why a crucial event in educational sector such as attendance should be done in the old boring traditional way.
Attendance monitoring system will save a lot of time and energy for the both parties students as well as the class teachers. This is the first attempt of developing attendance system which had been upgraded to  [face recognition](https://github.com/PalashHawee/Face-Recognition-System) facility  later as my mini project to detect the students photo captured by the system and save the data automatically in csv format.
